``When you come to any passage you don't understand, \emph{read it again}: if you \emph{still} don't understand it, \emph{read it again}: if you fail, even after \emph{three} readings, very likely your brain is getting a little tired. In that case, put the book away, and take to other occupations, and next day, when you come to it fresh, you will very likely find that it is \emph{quite} easy.

``If possible, find some genial friend, who will read the book along with you, and will talk over the difficulties with you. \emph{Talking} is a wonderful smoother-over of difficulties. When I come upon anything --- in Logic or in any other hard subject --- that entirely puzzles me, I find it a capital plan to talk it over, \emph{aloud}, even when I am all alone.''

\begin{flushright} Lewis Carroll,  \emph{Symbolic Logic} (1897) \end{flushright}
