Forall x @ Syr
==============

This is the Syracuse University edition of the open source *forall x* introductory logic textbook.  It is based on Tim Button's [*forall x: Cambridge*](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytbu/forallxcam.pdf), which is in turn based on P.D. Magnus' original [*forall x*](https://www.fecundity.com/logic/).  The present text is licensed under a [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. 

The main changes I've made compared to *forall x: Cambridge* are the following: 

* I've changed the first chapter to more closely reflect my own introductory lecture.  For example, I elucidate the modal notion of validity using possible worlds, and emphasize logic's focus on *formal* validity a bit more explicitly.
* I've added more on the semantics of truth-functional and especially first-order logic, particularly as concerns the construction of countermodels.  
* I've made some changes to set of natural deduction rules in both parts.
